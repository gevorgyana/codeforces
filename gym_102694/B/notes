root - best root to maximize diameter?
. . . x = 3
-----------
. . .   = 2
  x

the transformation will increase only one path a time by 1. the diameter
is the longest path, can there be many such paths? yes - a *-like graph
serves as an example. so there are 2 cases:

- increase the diameter - in this case increase it by 1 - we need to find
all the diametral leaves and if we add a node to
them, the diameter increases by 1;
- increase a non-diametral path - in this case it reaches length <=
diametral length, so we still return the diameter of the tree.

Use BFS to find all the diameters. First pass: reached X nodes, second
pass: reached Y nodes => X * Y possibilities to select the diameter, and
we know all of them.
